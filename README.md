# BlackJack

This was the last project in my first CS couse in college. I used composition of classes and learn about certain aspects of game handling. The computer player has a very simple AI running its behavior. Once the computer's handcount goes over 17, it stands. 

The challenging aspect of this project was the handling of aces, which change value as your hand changes. Aces can be 11 or 1 depending on the current hand.
